Compute backward parcel trajectories using CM1 output.

This code is a stripped-down version of the trajectory code in Ryan Hastings' 
cm1_pp package. Unlike Ryan's code, only user-specified fields are interpolated 
to the parcel locations, forward parcel integrations are not performed, and 
only RK4 can be used to integrate parcels in time. This results in cleaner code 
that *should* run faster. 

Unlike Ryan's code, this program does perform time interpolation between CM1
file dumps. This means that the timestep used in the RK4 scheme can be less than
the time between CM1 file dumps, which results in more accurate trajectories
than those using the time between file dumps as the timestep. This is 
illustrated by the tests that used different timesteps (found in the 'tests'
directory)

Although I have made several changes to this program, most of the code is still
Ryan's original code. I encourage visitors to also check out his cm1_pp program
on GitHub.
