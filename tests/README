This directory contains some of the files for three different tests:

1. Comparison between backward trajectories computed with different timesteps
    (but using 60 s between 3-D output file dumps) and forward parcel 
    trajectories computed while CM1 is integrated forwards in time. Timesteps
    tested include 60, 30, 15, 10, 5, and 1 s, and output is saved in the
    traj_test_XXs.nc files. The script compare_forward_backward_traj.py
    compares the forward and backward trajectories, with the forward 
    trajectories assumed to be the "truth." The CM1 3-D output file and forward
    parcel trajectory data needed to run this Python are not included in this
    directory.

2. Timing tests using different numbers of parcels. Output files are 
    traj_test_XXs_PYY.nc, where YY is the number of parcels and XX is the
    integration timestep.

3. Testing the interpolation of model variables to the backward parcel 
    locations. This is done in the test_interp.py script. As with test (1), this
    script requires 3-D CM1 output files, which are not included in this 
    directory.
